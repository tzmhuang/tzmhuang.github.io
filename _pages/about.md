I am currently a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu), working with [Prof. Eshed Ohn-Bar](https://eshed1.github.io) on computer vision, robotics and machine learning with their applications in autonomous and assistive systems.

Prior to BU, I worked as an algorithm engineer for an autonomous driving start up. And before that, I got my bachelor's degree from [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk), where I majored in Decision Analytics (combination of statistics and computer science), and minored in Mathematics.


I am currently looking to apply for PhD in the comming academic year.
